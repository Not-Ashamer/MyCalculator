# OmegaCalculator

This program makes a very advanced calculator which accepts a string which represents a mathematical expression.
The function should first make sure that the expression is a valid one, here meaning that it has at least one number,
operators that have acceptable values where they need to be depending on the type (infix, prefix, or postfix), 
that there are no invalid characters, etc. The calculator then solves this expression, and returns the result of simplifying the expression.
To run the calculator, you can run either main.py or gui_main.py, either will work, the difference being in 
whether you type your inputs directly into the console or into a simple window, and is otherwise identical.
To run any tests, you need to run the test_calculator.py file as a script with "python -m pytest", as well 
as make any changes to it. Additionally, you can type "rules" into the console to get a comprehensive list of all operators and their
logic, as well as examples of what will and won't work.
