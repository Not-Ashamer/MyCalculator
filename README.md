# OmegaCalculator

This program makes a very advanced calculator which accepts a string which represents a mathematical expression.
The function should first make sure that the expression is a valid one, here meaning that it has at least one number,
operators that have acceptable values where they need to be depending on the type (infix, prefix, or postfix), 
that there are no invalid characters, etc. The calculator then solves this expression, and returns the result of simplifying the expression.
